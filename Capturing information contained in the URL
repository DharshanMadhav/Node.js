//Declare a router with the following:
Imagine we need to send information from the client to the server about a car and we need to capture information contained in the URL.
As params pass maker (ford, nissan etc) and model (focus,sentra, etc)
As query string pass color, millage, engine
Create a response that prints something like that:
Values passed as params:
Maker: Ford
Model: Focus
Values passed as query string
Color: red
Millage:50k
Engine: 2.5L

//Code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/car/:maker/:model', (req, res) => {
    const { maker, model } = req.params;

  const { color, mileage, engine } = req.query;

  const response = `
    Values passed as params:
    Maker: ${maker}
    Model: ${model}
    
    Values passed as query string:
    Color: ${color || 'N/A'}
    Millage: ${mileage || 'N/A'}
    Engine: ${engine || 'N/A'}
  `;
  res.send(response);
});

const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
